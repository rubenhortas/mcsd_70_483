    /// necessary.

    /// SecureString implements IDispossable so you can make sure that its
    /// content is removed from memory whenever you're done with it.
    /// 
    /// Because SecureString needs to be initialized at some point, the data
    /// that is used to initialize it is still in memory. To minimize the risk
    /// SecureSTring can deal with only individual characters at a time.
